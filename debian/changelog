  * ld-libs: Try loading Exherbo architecture-specific ld.so cache
    before generic path.
    I'm using Exherbo as an example of a host OS with an unusual layout that
    breaks libcapsule's normal assumptions. As well as fixing Exherbo
    itself, this puts the framework in place to deal with other
    distributions' architecture-specific ld.so caches.
    - Developers of other distributions with unusual ld.so cache paths
      can edit ld_cache_filenames in utils/ld-cache.c and bind_usr() in
      tests/CapsuleTest.pm to teach libcapsule about their paths.
  * tests: Use libxml2 instead of libjpeg to test versioned symbols
  * tests: Make Exherbo architecture-specific ld.so stuff available too
  * tests: Allow even more variations of what a $libdir looks like

  [ Ludovico de Nittis ]
  * capture-libs: Add support for remapping link target prefix.
    If you don't want to change the link target for all the symlinks that
    will be created, instead of using `--link-target`, it is now possible to
    use the new `--remap-link-prefix` and just list the directories that
    should be located under a different target.

  [ Simon McVittie ]
  * debian: Suppress automatic debug symbols for libcapsule-tools-relocatable.
    The debug symbols for libcapsule-tools-relocatable would be the same as
    for libcapsule-tools, making them non-co-installable. Use the environment
    variable instead of --no-automatic-dbgsym for compatibility with
    Steam Runtime 1 'scout', which is too old to have that option.

  [ Ludovico de Nittis ]
  * capture-libs: Skip libs with unmet dependencies when "if exists" flag
    is set.
    If we have the CAPTURE_FLAG_IF_EXISTS option flag, we should not
    propagate an error if we are not able to find some dependencies of a
    library. Instead we should just skip it.
    This fixes an error that some users reported because they had some
    leftover unused libraries from the NVIDIA proprietary driver,
    and libcapsule reported an error while trying to capture their
    (missing) dependencies.

  * debian: Delete files that were generated by gtk-doc during dist.
    This fixes failure to build from the tarball with gtk-doc >= 1.30,
    when the tarball was generated with older gtk-doc.

  [ Ludovico de Nittis ]
  * utils: Add public/private knowledge about symbol versions and symbols.
    We are now able to list the symbol versions and/or symbols that are
    known to be public/private.
    This is especially useful for comparing libraries that removed symbol
    versions, or symbols, from one release to another. As this already
    happened multiple times in the past, like for example with
    `libdrm_nouveau.so.2` or `libedit.so.2`.

libcapsule (0.20200708.0-0co1) upstream; urgency=medium

  [ Ludovico de Nittis, Simon McVittie ]
  * utils: Add functions to compare symbols and versions with libelf.
    When two libraries have the same numeric tail we were not able to
    reliably determine which one was the newer. In particular, many
    distributions install libgcc_s.so.1 as a regular file, rather than
    a symlink to a versioned name, so library_cmp_by_name() can't work.

  [ Simon McVittie ]
  * ci: Run CI with UndefinedBehaviourSanitizer and AddressSanitizer
  * tests: Work around a binutils behaviour change (see #964457)
  * capture-libs: Make library comparison configurable on the command-line.
    This is primarily useful for testing and experimenting.
  * capture-libs: Add --library-knowledge option.
    This gives capsule-capture-libs a source of library-specific knowledge,
    which we can use to choose the correct library. (T16562)

libcapsule (0.20200624.0-0co1) upstream; urgency=medium

  * ld-libs: Always clear ldlibs->needed entry if ld_lib_open() fails,

  * capsule-malloc: Remove duplicate typedef for mstate, for clang 8
  * Distinguish between enabling the library and enabling shared libraries.
    Some tests for capsule-capture-libs will need to compile shared
    libraries, even if libcapsule itself is not built.
  * tests: Make older linkers happy with one of our test libraries
  * tests: Cope with newer versions of GNU make
  * debian: Tell git-version-gen that we are behaving as an upstream

  * capture-libs: Clarify by introducing more temporaries
  * capture-libs: Factor out library_cmp_by_name()
  * capture-libs: Treat unversioned libraries as in indeterminate order.
    This avoids always choosing the container version of libgcc_s.so.1
    when using a Debian-derived container on Fedora, even if the host
    version is newer.
