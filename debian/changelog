    * Don't bind-mount /efi into containers, same as /boot
    * Slightly better debug info for failures
    * Use a better XML DOCTYPE for fonts.conf

  * pressure-vessel: Update included copy of bubblewrap to 0.7.0
    - Improve error messages
    - The remaining changes are not relevant to pressure-vessel.

      even if that's /dev/null
    - Send warnings and error messages to the systemd journal (on systems
      where it exists) if they would otherwise go to /dev/null
    - If output is going to the systemd journal, create our own stream so
      that it is labelled correctly

  * pressure-vessel: Add support for FEX-Emu graphics library thunking.
    When emulating x86 on aarch64, FEX-Emu optionally loads thin x86
    graphics driver libraries that make calls into the underlying aarch64
    graphics drivers, instead of implementing the whole user-space part
    of the graphics driver in x86 code that needs to be emulated. To
    make this work as intended, we have to ensure that the search path
    for each of these categories includes both the x86 version from the
    FEX-Emu rootfs and the aarch64 version from the host system:
    - Vulkan drivers and layers
    - EGL drivers and external platforms
    - GLX drivers
    - Mesa DRI drivers
    - VA-API drivers
    Doing this for VDPAU drivers is not currently supported, because VDPAU
    only searches a single directory, not a search path.

  * pressure-vessel: If using libudev from the host, provide read-only
    access to /run/udev.
    This is sufficient to identify non-hotplugged game controllers in
    games that use libudev directly (older bundled SDL versions, or not
    using SDL at all).
    - Controller hotplug support continues to require using an up-to-date
      version of SDL or Proton.
    - This is not done for older host OSs (Debian 10, Ubuntu 18.04, etc.)
      because on these older OSs we have to use the container's libudev,
      but the host /run/udev is not necessarily compatible with that.
    (steamrt/tasks#171)
  * tests: Fix test failure with Arch Linux glibc ≥ 2.36-4

  [ Simon McVittie ]
  * pv-runtime: Use host's libudev if equal to or newer than container
    libudev, even if no graphics driver depends on it.
    This makes it more likely that we can parse /run/udev.

  * libcurl-compat: When building for scout (only), build a shim libcurl
    that can dispatch to runtime or system copies.
    This works around ABI divergence from upstream in the libcurl in
    Debian/Ubuntu between about 2005 and 2018, which unfortunately includes
    the time at which Steam Runtime 1 'scout' started. Additional setup in
    the steam-runtime scripts is necessary to take advantage of this.

  * pv-wrap: Use $PRESSURE_VESSEL_BWRAP in preference to $BWRAP
  * pv-wrap: Use local copy of bwrap in preference to system copy.
    The system copy might be older and less featureful, or might be
    unnecessarily setuid, so let's try to use a version that is under our
    control. If it works, great. If not, we can try a system copy, which
    we might have to use anyway (for example on Debian 10, RHEL 7 or
    SteamOS 2).

  * pv-wrap: Make graphics drivers outside $HOME available, if used
    (Resolves: #29, steam-runtime#313)
  * pv-wrap: Refactor collection of DRI drivers so we use all the search
    paths that SrtGraphics knows about
    - Also look for Mesa DRI drivers in ${libdir}/xorg/modules/dri,
      used on Slackware (Resolves: steam-runtime#318)
  * pv-wrap: Don't assume container's env is in the PATH.
    Some OS distributions, notably Exherbo, don't put /usr/bin in their
    PATH. This means we can't safely use their PATH to invoke standard tools
    inside the container. (Partially addresses steam-runtime#230)
  * pv-wrap: Always disable gtk3-nocsd.
    This module interposes in front of g_object_get(), and is known to cause
    crashes, even in programs that use GObject but not GTK.
    (Resolves: steam-runtime#286)
  * pv-wrap: Cope with /tmp being a symlink.
    If /tmp is a symlink in the current execution environment, then when
    we ask bwrap to bind-mount /tmp/pressure-vessel-wrap.XXXXXX/overrides
    over itself, it will try to create the parent directory /tmp, and fail
    because there's a symlink in the way. Canonicalize the path and use that
    instead. Partially addresses steam-runtime#321 (symlinks "above" the home
    directory have the same problem, but are harder to fix).
  * Improve diagnostic tools bundled with relocatable pressure-vessel:
    - Don't wrap steam-runtime-system-info, so it can find its helpers
    - Include vulkaninfo and wflinfo in relocatable installs
  * pv-wrap: Remove --host-fallback option.
    We are not going to be able to do this from within Flatpak, and it is
    unsuitable for running runtimes other than Steam Runtime 1 'scout',
    for which the LD_LIBRARY_PATH runtime mostly already works.
    If we need an automatic fallback to running on the host for scout games,
    we can do that better by running `pressure-vessel-wrap --test`.
  * pressure-vessel: Speed up execution of short-lived subprocesses.
    In particular, if the soft limit on open file descriptors is very large
    (formerly recommended for Proton "esync", although the current
    recommendation is to set a small soft limit and a large hard limit)
    this can speed up pressure-vessel by as much as 90%. In more normal
    configurations it can still save 10%. (Resolves: steam-runtime#323)
  * pressure-vessel: Stop running bwrap --help, no longer needed.
  * pv-wrap: Log pressure-vessel version on startup.
    This serves two purposes: it gives us a timestamp for when
    pressure-vessel started, and it puts the version number in the log.
  * Preparatory work for being able to run inside Flatpak:
    - system-info: Look in both /overrides and /usr/lib/p-v/overrides
    - pv-wrap: In Flatpak, use pv-launch to run commands on the host
    - pv-wrap: Remap $HOME for Flatpak correctly
    - pv-wrap: In Flatpak, put game in same userns/pidns as Steam if possible

  [ Simon McVittie ]
  * runtime: Expand libqual into an array of multilib directories.
    This is a step towards searching all the necessary places for unusual
    distributions like Exherbo (see steam-runtime#230), and gives us
    an obvious extension point for adding more multilib directories.
  * runtime: Don't issue warnings when unable to delete from runtime copy
  * pressure-vessel-unruntime: Don't assume bash is at /bin/bash.
    Apparently NixOS puts it somewhere else.
  * pressure-vessel: Fix a wrong assertion that prevented running the
    container with libraries from the host system instead of a runtime.
    Steam never does this, but it's occasionally useful for debugging.
  * pressure-vessel: Make /nix available read-only, if it exists.
    This is necessary (but not sufficient!) for NixOS support.
  * pressure-vessel: Make sure ~/.steam is available in the container,
    even if it's a symbolic link (steam-runtime#291)
  * pressure-vessel-wrap: Add environment variables to share filesystems
  * pressure-vessel: Make STEAM_EXTRA_COMPAT_TOOLS_PATHS available
    (partially addresses steam-runtime#302)
  * input-device: Add a new API for input device enumeration and monitoring.
    This can list and inspect input devices using libudev or directly, and
    is potentially a basis for a future input device portal (see
    steam-runtime-tools#11).
  * system-info: Detect whether the expected runtime linker is present.
    On operating systems with unusual path layouts, such as Exherbo and
    NixOS, the de facto standard path for the runtime linker is not
    necessarily present for all architectures.
    (Of course, if the x86_64 runtime linker is not present, we won't
    normally be able to run steam-runtime-system-info either, but at least
    users of such operating systems can compile it from source code if they
    need to provide diagnostics.)
  * bin: Add new steam-runtime-input-monitor diagnostic tool
  * bin, pressure-vessel: Disable GIO modules differently.

  * pressure-vessel: Treat LD_LIBRARY_PATH as system libraries.
    At this stage we expect to have `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` set to the
    `SYSTEM_LD_LIBRARY_PATH` of `steam.sh`.
    This means that we should treat the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` entries as
    OS-level search path too.
  * pressure-vessel-unruntime: Support PRESSURE_VESSEL_APP_LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  * pressure-vessel: Add support for Vulkan layers.
    When we use the provider graphics stack we also try to collect the
    available Vulkan layers, similarly to what we already do for ICDs.
    (T24365, T24347, T24348)
  * pressure-vessel: use the new libcapsule "--remap-link-prefix" option.
    Using the new "--remap-link-prefix" option we can now avoid breaking
    symlinks not available under `/run/host`, such as Vulkan layers or
    drivers in the home directory or in /opt. (steam-runtime-tools#29)
  * pressure-vessel: Include host's fonts in the newly built container.
    Soldier and Scout include a limited set of fonts that doesn't cover all
    use cases. For example it is missing the necessary glyphs for Asian
    languages. For this change to be effective, the container also needs an
    updated steamrt-container-host-compat package.

  * Reapply "runtime: Set STEAM_RUNTIME=/ if running in scout".
    This will reassure some games, particularly those ported by Feral
    Interactive, that they are running in the right environment.
    Last time we tried this, it broke GTK in scout, but since then we have

  * wrap, launcher: Add an environment variable locking system.
    If we want to pass all the possible variables that a user might have set
    in the environment, then we need a mechanism to lock the variables that
    pressure-vessel is editing (e.g. LIBGL_DRIVERS_PATH), variables that we
    want to keep unset because will be wrong in the new container (e.g.

    This gives us access to the same tricks that Flatpak uses to get host

    links plus a separate mount point for the target (which we previously

    Recent versions of Flatpak and systemd-nspawn can mount the host's

  * runtime: Fix logic for whether to mount over an executable.
    When using a scout sysroot with a newer-than-scout host, we were not

    Resolves: T22877
  * wrap: Add a minimal implementation of --filesystem.
    This is like `flatpak run --filesystem`, but for now much, much simpler;
    callers are responsible for not giving us paths that will be a problem.
    However, it's enough to bind-mount subdirectories of /tmp, which is
    what we need if we want to use them as IPC rendezvous points.
  * launcher: Add ability to run multiple commands in one container.
    See the new pressure-vessel-launcher(1) man page for details.
    We need this for Proton games, where running a game takes several

    tests/containers.py was failing on SteamOS 2 'brewmaster' with the
    libc6-i686 package installed, because that package contains an
    optimized i686 glibc in /lib/i386-linux-gnu/i686/cmov/libc.so.6, which
    is used in preference to the baseline i586 glibc in
    /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6. There are no corresponding optimized
    gconv modules, only /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/gconv/*.
  * tests: Add support for basic testing on a soldier container.
    For the moment, this is basically scout with fewer guarantees: we
    can't assume whether the host glibc is newer (like Arch Linux or
    Ubuntu 20.04) or older (like SteamOS 2 'brewmaster'). (T22544)
  * tests: Run s-r-s-i on host with LD_BIND_NOW=1.
    If we allow lazy binding, we can succeed in loading a GIO module from
    the host (which depends on a newer GObject than the one bundled with
    pressure-vessel), then find that a symbol reference fails at the time
    that we try to actually use it. Make it fail early, instead.
    In particular, this is helpful on SteamOS 2 'brewmaster'.
  * tests: Ignore inability to load libOSMesa.so.8.
    This is included in prerelease versions of SteamRT 2 'soldier',
    but because it uses the post-gcc-5 C++ ABI of libLLVM-7.so.1, it's
    incompatible with versions of libLLVM-7.so.1 that were compiled to be
    compatible with the gcc 4 C++ ABI, and in particular the one in
    SteamOS 2 'brewmaster'.
    This and the previous commit are sufficient to make tests/containers.py
    pass on SteamOS 2 'brewmaster', if we also configure libxcb.so.1 to
    be chosen by counting symbols (T22538) and libgcc_s.so.1 to be chosen
    by counting verdefs (T16561).

  * unruntime, wrap: Add a way to disable all interactivity.
    This is desirable if we are running something other than the main game,
    for example steam-runtime-system-info or various preparatory steps
    involved in running Proton.
  * wrap: Import Steam compat tool data. (T22360)
    This is necessary for Steam "compat tools" such as Proton.
    STEAM_COMPAT_DATA_PATH points to data associated with the current
    (compat tool, game) pair, for example the ${WINEPREFIX}.
    STEAM_COMPAT_TOOL_PATH doesn't exist yet, but I'm assuming that it will
    be set by some later version of the Steam client to point to Proton
    itself.
    STEAM_COMPAT_CLIENT_INSTALL_PATH points to the Steam installation. This
    is hopefully in the home directory, so hopefully we bind-mount it anyway;
    but if we don't, we should.
  * runtime: Add arguments to the right bwrap invocation.
    When we're entering the container to generate locales, we need to
    bind-mount the staging area for /overrides in *that* bwrap invocation,
    not add it as a bind-mount to the bwrap invocation that will actually
    run the game. (T22534)
  * runtime: Factor out beginning of capsule-capture-libs command-line.
    This doesn't currently include the --dest because that varies - it's
    usually arch->libdir_on_host, but not always.
  * runtime: Pass --library-knowledge to capsule-capture-libs if possible.
    For runtimes that support it, this gives us a way to override library
    comparisons. In particular, we can make sure libgcc_s.so.1 is compared
    by its version-definitions and symbols. (T16561, T16562)
  * run-in-sysroot: Copy host /etc/passwd, /etc/group.
    Otherwise, any test that refers to the username or home directory will
    fail with a warning. Prior to GLib 2.35.9 (in particular, in GLib 2.32)
    this happens in g_get_any_init_do(), which is also called to get the
    TMPDIR, so any test that wants to create a temporary directory will
    fail like this.

  * Bind VDPAU drivers.
    If available, and newer, we bind VDPAU drivers from the host system.
  * Bind VA-API drivers and loaders.
    If available, and newer, we bind VA-API drivers and loaders from the
    host system.
  * runtime: handle merged-/usr host OS with non merged-/usr container.
    Prioritize "/usr/" over "/lib/" if it is available to avoid issues when
    we use a non merged-/usr container with a host system that is
    merged-/usr. (T22125)

  [ Simon McVittie ]
  * Update libglnx subproject from upstream
  * runtime: Look for ldconfig in /sbin, /usr/sbin.
    If we are on an OS where /sbin is not normally in unprivileged users'
    PATHs (for example Debian), we won't find ldconfig in PATH and will
    need to try harder.
  * runtime: Reset PATH in the container.
    The PATH from outside the container doesn't really make sense inside
    the container, because the directory hierarchy could be totally different
    (particularly on unusual host systems like GoboLinux and Exherbo).
    Resetting it also makes sure we don't pick up local installations in
    ~/bin or ~/.local/bin, which could have dependencies that are
    unsatisfied in the container.
    Conversely, the PATH from the host might not include everything we need
    in the container.
  * runtime: Don't critical if we were unable to lock the runtime
  * runtime: Add an option to skip generating missing locales.
    This is one of the slower parts of the whole process, and not all
    games (or automated tests) even need it.
  * runtime: Factor out a struct to hold architecture-specific details
  * runtime: Save a bwrap invocation and a shell by not using globbing
  * runtime: Sort DRI "search path" more carefully.
    As noted in the comment, the order matters.
  * runtime: Access runtime without using bwrap if possible
  * runtime: Optionally copy the runtime, and bind-mount the copy.
    This is good for two reasons. In a Flatpak runtime, we will not be able
    to do tricks with arbitrary bind-mounts; if we want the host library
    stack, we will have to rewrite the mutable copy of the runtime to
    replace container libraries with symlinks into /run/host. Also, when
    not in a Flatpak runtime, having a mutable copy of the immutable runtime
    gives developers a chance to edit the runtime to inject workarounds or
    things they're testing. (T18688, T22035)
  * bwrap: When we bind /usr, also bind /etc/ld.so.conf*
    We'll need those if we want to run ldconfig.
  * wrap: Add the ability to unshare the pid namespace.
    We can use this to test whether it can be done without breaking Steam
    (currently it cannot, unless you unload the gameoverlayrenderer.so
    module).
  * wrap: Really fail on invalid --env-if-host argument
  * locale-gen: Add --output-dir option
  * wrap-interactive: Fix display of pressure-vessel-wrap's name
  * wrap-interactive: Print exit status before --shell=after
  * wrap-interactive: Print exit status before "Enter to continue" prompt
  * utils: Preserve permissions when copying, and fall back to reflink or
    copy if hard link fails
  * scripts: Assert that we have the desired Python version.
    We require Python 3.5 (backports exist in both Steam Runtime 1 'scout'
    and Steam Runtime 1½ 'heavy'), except for scripts that are meant to run
    on test machines or non-developer Steam users' machines, which require
    Python 3.4 (SteamOS 2, Debian 8, Ubuntu 14.04).

    Rephrase it so that in the UI, unsharing the home directory looks like
    the active choice ("separate home directory"), with the shared home
    directory as the passive/default choice.
  * test-ui: Clarify what the "no runtime" choice means

    Now that deb-build-snapshot supports a Build-Suffix option in

    suffix added by the Open Build Service.

pressure-vessel (0.20200108.0-0+steamrt1.1) scout; urgency=medium

  * wrap: Don't pass --lock-file to bwrap.
    This is redundant with us passing the fd to be held by
    pressure-vessel-with-lock, and it causes bwrap to produce the wrong
    exit status (see https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap/issues/336
    and https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap/pull/325).
  * bwrap-lock: Add support for OFD locks.
    On Linux >= 3.15, this allows us to pass a lock fd to a child process
    across bwrap's fork-and-exec the way we were already trying to, and
    have it actually work.
  * wrap: Tell child process to take out its own lock if necessary.
    Non-OFD locks don't propagate across fork(), and bwrap needs to clone()
    itself (which behaves like fork() in this respect) to separate itself
    into a parent outside the container and a child inside the container.
    This change adds a weak dependency on Linux 3.15. If we run on an older
    version, everything should still *work*, but there will be a short
    period of time during which we have already decided to use the runtime,
    but it is not locked (and in particular not protected from deletion).

  * Use timeout(1) when checking libraries
  * Add exit_status and terminating_signal to SrtGraphics and SrtLibrary.
    If helper fails, times out or is killed we now report its exit status
    and terminating signal, if any.
  * Add and use srt_enum_value_to_nick to make string formatting for
    enum/flags types less repetitive

  * Move symbolic links to dependencies to new
    libsteam-runtime-tools-0-relocatable-libs, and add Build-Conflicts on it.
    Since steam-runtime-tools was made relocatable in c3a06cce, its build
    would fail with the Steam Runtime 1 'scout' version of dpkg if it is
    already installed system-wide.
  * debian: Add missing symbols file entries from 0.20191120.0
  * Remove trailing whitespace from source code

  * Check whether GLX drivers can actually draw to an X11 window.
    This provides a more thorough test than wflinfo.
  * Check whether Vulkan drivers can actually draw to an X11 window.
    This provides a more thorough test than vulkaninfo.
  * Fix reporting of timeouts in JSON

  [ Simon McVittie ]
  * Build selected executables with a RPATH.
    This allows a copy of steam-runtime-system-info bundled in the
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH Steam Runtime to find the copies of
    libsteam-runtime-tools and libjson-glib in the same Runtime.
  * Look for wflinfo, vulkaninfo and libraries adjacent to
    libsteam-runtime-tools
  * Use g++-4.8 if default g++ is older
  * Build shaders using glslangValidator
  * Fix many compiler warnings
  * check-vulkan: Add basic command-line parsing with --help
  * Add --version argument to most executables
  * check-vulkan: Optionally make the window visible
  * Look for -check-vulkan in default helpers path, not in PATH
  * check-vulkan: Look for shaders in the correct place when installed
  * Add build-dependencies for check-gl

  [ Ludovico de Nittis ]
  * Add support for libraries with hidden dependencies
  * Detect GLX and EGL graphics library vendor (either GLVND,
    legacy non-GLVND Mesa, legacy non-GLVND NVIDIA, or other non-GLVND)

  * locale: fix leaked SrtLocale

  [ Simon McVittie ]
  * graphics, library: Capture stderr from the checks
    and include it in their JSON output
  * locale: Check for the necessary files to generate more locales.
    This issue flag is known to appear on Arch Linux and its derivatives,
    which don't normally install /usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED.
  * Generate autocleanup functions if GLib (or libglnx) supports it.
    This is not directly useful in steam-runtime-tools because we only
    require an older GLib, but is useful when reused in pressure-vessel.
  * Add some missing precondition checks
  * Assert we are not setuid before looking at the environment
  * graphics: Add EGL and Vulkan ICD enumeration
  * Distinguish between the Steam installation (root) and data paths.
    We had previously mixed these up: it isn't particularly obvious since
    they are usually the same. See the documentation for details.
